Postdoc position on the computational modeling of the large-scale spread of swine infectious diseases. Project funded for 3 years.

Main role: We are searching for a motivated postdoctoral researcher to co-lead the development of a new computational tool for analyzing the spread of swine diseases. This position will be centered on the development of mechanistic models which explicitly consider transmission dynamics in space and time. The focus here is on the development and dissemination of a forecast/prediction treatment regimen for precision and optimal resource allocation to help the swine industry efficiently preempt and manage outbreaks. The postdoctoral researcher will calibrate dynamic mathematical to unique data that has been fully collected and curated.

The available data set includes: full animal movement data at farm level, weekly disease occurrence with genetic sequences, complete on-farm biosecurity, and disease intervention for a span of two years and more. For more details of previous work and data available read:1,2,3.In summary, this work will unravel transmission, estimate epidemic parameters, identify spread determinants, and assess the impact of interventions. In addition, a number of potential research projects are available and so the research focus may be tailored to the interests and skills of the individual. There will also be opportunities to seek grant funding to develop related, independent research. Access to high-powered computing is available through Machado's labLab website ([](https://machado-lab.github.io/)[https://machado-lab.github.io/](https://machado-lab.github.io/)).

Qualifications:

1.  The ideal candidate has a Ph.D. degree in a relevant quantitative discipline (computational biology, engineering, ecology, epidemiology, applied mathematics, physics, computer sciences, statistics, or another quantitative field).
2.  Previous experience with multi-scale mathematical models will be given the highest consideration.
3.  It is critical that the selected candidate have moderate to extensive experience in R or other open-source-related statistical software.
4.  Previous work-related with spatial analysis and or network analysis.
5.  Practical experience with building spatially explicit models, particularly those that are also process-based and mechanistic model development.
6.  Evidence of original publications in the peer-reviewed literature.
7.  Good communication and experience in developing grant proposals and taking the lead in projects.
8.  Ability to work independently and in collaboration. As part of the position, the candidate will publish and present their work at conferences.

Position terms: The initial appointment will be from 12 to 18 months, but three years of federal funding have already been secured. Salary is expected to be in the range of $50,000, will be commensurate with the qualifications and experience of the individuals. Travel and health insurance are included. A starting date of January 2022 or earlier is preferred. Screening of applications will begin immediately. Environment: The Machado Lab develops and deploys epidemiological methods which fully integrate disease evolution, animal movement, spatial processes to estimate disease transmission and spread. Ultimately we work in the development of new computational tools for both tracking spread and prescribing non-pharmaceutical interventions regimens. New members, will work in a group with a strong background in epidemiology, disease spread modeling, evolutionary epidemiology, social networks, and mathematical modeling. The new member will benefit from the national and international collaboration networks that our lab has developed.
